This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).
No hooks

## Overview
Here is my responsive React Random User app which easily created with no build configuration ([Creating an App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app#creating-an-app))

### Application Requirements:

- [x] Use https://randomuser.me/api/?results=25 to request for an array of users
- [x] When the application loads, the list of users should be fetched without any user input
- [x] Each list item must display at least: User first and last names, profile image, city, state and email, if available 
- [x] Display a male icon for male users, and a female icon for female users
- [x] Only For Users with “US” nationality, display a small American flag for that user 
- [x] Each user list item must have a button, labeled as “Delete”. Clicking on this button should remove the user from the list (until the next browser refresh) 

Note: Like always make sure to break down this project into steps rather than trying to do everything at once. Enjoy!
